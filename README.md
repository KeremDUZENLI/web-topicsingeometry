# Topics in Geometry - Interactive Notes

Welcome to the **Topics in Geometry - Interactive Notes** repository! This project is a web-based interactive resource designed for the **IPPV202-K2 - Topics in Geometry** course at the University of Debrecen, Faculty of Informatics. It focuses on key concepts from **Geza Schay's "A Concise Introduction to Linear Algebra"**, specifically:

- **1.2 Length and Dot Product of Vectors in Rⁿ**
- **6.3 The Cross Product of Vectors in R³**

The website provides an engaging way to explore questions and answers related to these topics, with embedded PDF viewers for seamless access to solutions. You can access it here:

## Project Purpose

This project was developed to support students in the Topics in Geometry course by offering an interactive platform to study linear algebra concepts. It includes:

- **Interactive Navigation**: Cycle through questions using "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
- **Embedded Solutions**: Answers are displayed in PDF viewers directly on the page.
- **Mathematical Clarity**: Equations are rendered beautifully with MathJax.
- **Responsive Layout**: Works smoothly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## My Contribution

I, **Kerem Düzenli**, created this project as part of my PhD coursework at the University of Debrecen. My goal was to build a tool that enhances the learning experience for students studying linear algebra, making it interactive and accessible. I designed the website, integrated the PDF viewers, and ensured the content aligns with the course material from _A Concise Introduction to Linear Algebra_.
